# ATM_System
For this project, I developed a database management system using the Python programming language and MySQL as the relational database management system. The goal of this project was to create a system that allows users to easily perform various transactions on the data stored in the database.

One of the key features of this system is its ability to automatically create the database if it does not already exist. This ensures that users can start using the system without having to manually set up the database beforehand. The system also provides an intuitive interface for users to perform common transactions such as creating, updating, deleting and querying data.

To achieve this functionality, I used the MySQL Connector/Python module to establish a connection between the Python code and the MySQL server. This module provides a simple and consistent API for interacting with the MySQL database from within Python code.

In terms of data manipulation, the system provides users with a range of options for managing their data. For example, users can create new records in the database by providing the necessary information through the systemâ€™s interface. The system then takes this information and generates the appropriate SQL statements to insert the data into the database.

Similarly, users can update existing records in the database by providing new values for one or more fields. The system generates the necessary SQL statements to update the data in the database accordingly. Users can also delete records from the database by specifying which records they want to remove. The system generates the appropriate SQL statements to delete these records from the database.

In addition to these basic data manipulation operations, the system also provides users with powerful querying capabilities. Users can specify complex search criteria to retrieve data from the database that meets their specific needs. The system generates the necessary SQL statements to perform these queries and returns the results to the user.

Overall, this project demonstrates how Python and MySQL can be used together to create a powerful and user-friendly database management system. By providing an intuitive interface for performing common transactions on data stored in a MySQL database, this system makes it easy for users to manage their data effectively.
